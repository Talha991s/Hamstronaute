 *  Description: A simple way of pausing the game opposed to more involved methods. 'Time.timeScale = 0' can be used as a way to pause the game; 
 *  This is basically a wrapper for Time.timeScale. UI buttons and Update() should still work.
 *  "Except for realtimeSinceStartup and fixedDeltaTime, timeScale affects all the time and delta time measuring variables of the Time class... 
 *  FixedUpdate functions will not be called when timeScale is set to zero."
 *  This means all movement should be multiplied by Time.deltaTime for the pause effect to work. 
 *  If you don't want to use Time.deltaTime in a movement (eg. rotation) use SimplePausingScr.IsGamePaused() to check whether 
 *  or not the game is paused. Then, disable controls or movement if the function returns true.
 *  
 *  Note: This script does not tamper with UI by design. This way if the UI breaks, it's not because of this script.
